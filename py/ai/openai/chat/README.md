# GPT-3.5-powered Question Answering Program

This Python program utilizes the power of OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo to generate answers to questions provided by the user. The program prompts the user for a question and a context and then generates an answer in the specified target language using GPT-3.5 Turbo.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository.

2. Install the necessary Python packages using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install openai
   ```

3. Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your OpenAI API key.

4. Run the program and input the question and context when prompted.

## How it Works

The program leverages GPT-3.5 Turbo, a highly advanced language generation model by OpenAI. It forms a query to GPT-3.5 Turbo by providing a question and context as input. The GPT-3.5 Turbo model generates a response to the question based on the input provided, and the program extracts and displays the answer.
